# Black-Friday-Sales-Analysis-Data-Analytics-with-Python

Welcome to the Black Friday Sales Analysis project — a data analytics deep-dive using Python and its powerful ecosystem of libraries. This project showcases essential data analysis skills, from data cleaning and transformation, to exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving actionable insights from real-world consumer behavior data.

Leveraging Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy this project walks through the analytical process step-by-step. The dataset, provided by a major retail store, contains purchase records for Black Friday — giving us a window into customer demographics, spending patterns, and preferences.

Whether you're a beginner exploring your first dataset or a professional refining your analytics pipeline, this project demonstrates practical data analysis workflows in Python that mirror real industry tasks.
